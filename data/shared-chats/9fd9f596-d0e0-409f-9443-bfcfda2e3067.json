It relies on the principles of supply and demand and trader behavior to forecast future trends. Key tools used in technical analysis include charting techniques, indicators (such as moving averages and RSI), and oscillators that help quantify market conditions. The approach is distinct from fundamental analysis, which focuses on economic fundamentals rather than price movements. Real-world applications demonstrate the effectiveness of technical analysis in making informed investment decisions, highlighting its significance in understanding market dynamics and sentiment to drive profitable trading strategies."}]}
